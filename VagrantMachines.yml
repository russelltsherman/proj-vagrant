# VagrantMachine.yml
#
# List of hosts to be created by Vagrant.
# This file controls the Vagrant settings, specifically host name and network settings.
# You should at least have a `name:`.
# Other optional settings that can be specified:
#
# * `hostname`:
# Specify the hostname for the machine
#
# * `box`:
# by default the vagrant box ubuntu/xenial64 will be used.
# If you want a different box, specify it.
#
# * `cpus`:
# by default the vagrnat box will be configured with 1 cpu
# If more are required, specify the count.
#
# * `memory`:
# by default the vagrnat box will be configured with 512 mb
# If more is required, specify the size in mb.
#
# * `forwarded_ports`:
# A list of forwarded ports. Required items are `host` and 'guest`
# For the possible options, see the Vagrant documentation[1].
#
# * `shell_always`:
# a list of shell scripts to be run after boot of the machine.
# For the possible options, see the Vagrant documentation[2].
# Required field is `cmd` having the path
#
# * `synced_folders`:
# A list of dicts that specify synced folders.
# `src` and `dest` are mandatory, `options:` are optional.
# For the possible options, see the Vagrant documentation[3].
# Keys of options should be prefixed with a colon, e.g. `:owner:`.
#
# * `network`:
# specify config for public or private network configuration
# each network type will accept the following parameters.
#
# * `address`:
# by default, an IP will be assigned by DHCP.
# If you want a fixed address, specify it.
#
# * `netmask`:
# by default, the network mask is `255.255.255.0`.
# If you want another one, it should be specified.
#
# * `mac`:
# The MAC address to be assigned to the NIC.
# Several notations are accepted
#   "Linux-style" (`00:11:22:33:44:55`)
#   "Windows-style" (`00-11-22-33-44-55`).
# The separator characters can be omitted altogether (`001122334455`).
#
# * `intnet`:
# If set to `true`, the network interface will be attached to an
# internal network rather than a host-only adapter.
#
# * `auto_config`:
# If set to `false`, Vagrant will not attempt to configure the network interface.
